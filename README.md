This repository is a collection of brainfuck interpreters in multiple languages

Brain... fuck?
--------------
[Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Brainfuck.27s_formal_.22parent_language.22) is a [Turing-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) programming language that mimics a [Turing Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). The objective of this language is to making interpreters \& compilers as short as possible. And of course, brain-fucking whoever reads the source code.


Testing Methodology
-------------------
Each interpreter is tested with helloworld \& [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).
